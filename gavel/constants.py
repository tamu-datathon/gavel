Welcome to Gavel.

This is the judging system we’re using for **TAMU Datathon 2019**. 
It’s fully automated and randomly assigns you teams to judge, tells you where to go, and tracks the votes you give to teams. 

Following are the rules and instructions for using Gavel:

- The system is based on the model of pairwise comparison. You’ll start off by looking at a single submission, and then for every submission after that, you’ll decide whether it’s better or worse than the one you looked at **immediately beforehand**.

- If at any point, you can't find a particular submission, you can click the ‘Skip’ button and you will be assigned a new project. **Please don’t skip unless absolutely necessary.**

- Gavel makes it really simple for you to submit votes, but please think hard before you vote. **Once you make a decision, you can’t take it back**.

Click **Done** once you've understood the rules.
